# Attendance_Management_System
Here I have created Attendance Management System for college. Here we have ways to login. First as an Admin, Second as an Teacher and last one is login as an Student. 
In Admin section Admin can Add Student, Add Teacher, View all student, View all Teacher, Update any student's details with RollNo and can Update any Teacher's details with there ID.
In Teacher section teacher can mark attendance for Fy, Sy, Ty Students and there attendence will be marked with current date in the database.
In Student section student can see his attendance, total lecture attended, percentage of his attendence and date on which he was absent or present.
To Open this file you have to open this folder in Microsoft Visual Studio Code and have to use microsoft SQL Server Management studio 18 as an database.
